<h3><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>


<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice, you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way, you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word [<i>in</i>] means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while [<i>off</i>] indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
[<i>off, coming in</i>] are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words [<i>mob</i>] or [<i>crowd
noise</i>] you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>In the year 1661 Connecticut received from the hand of
Charles the Second a very liberal charter granting to the
people of the colony almost complete self-government
and to the colony an enormous stretch of territory extending
westward to the Pacific Ocean. For fifteen years the
colony prospered under the generous charter. Then in
1676 trouble arose with the Governor of New York, Sir
Edmund Andros, about the boundary line between the
two colonies. Andros demanded authority over all the
land west of the Connecticut River. Governor Treat of
Connecticut refused to submit. Andros threatened to
seize the disputed land. Treat defied him. Andros fitted
out three ships, embarked a military force, and set out for
Saybrooke, Connecticut. Treat ordered out the militia,
garrisoned the fort at Saybrooke, and waited.</p>

<p>Our first scene is in the fort on the morning of July 9,
1676. The Governor is at breakfast when he hears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Come along, then. Lieutenant Allyn, how many ships did
you see? [<i>crowd noises swell up</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Indeed I will, if he has the courage to come ashore without
a guard! I can do no less than meet him at the shore.
Come along, Lieutenant. [<i>calling</i>] Stand by, men, ready

<p>Well, Governor, I'll have you know that I have come here

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So Governor Andros took his departure without gaining
possession of the territory he claimed. For the next ten
years Connecticut continued in undisputed possession of
her charter, and then on December 19, 1686, Andros was
appointed Governor of all New England. News of this
appointment reached Connecticut several months later.</p>

<p>Our next scene is at the State House in Hartford. It is
June of 1687. The General Court of the Connecticut
Colony is in session. As our scene opens, Governor Treat
is addressing the Assembly.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Gentlemen! I have called you here to consider a matter
of grave importance to the life of this colony. As you
know, His Majesty has seen fit to deprive us of our rights
under our charter and has appointed a Governor who is
to have supreme power over this colony and all of New
England.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Your Excellency&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, Captain Wadsworth?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Let us not submit! Let us appeal to the Privy Council!
We have our rights under the charter.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Yes, yes! Let us not submit!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>It is useless, gentlemen. When we are ordered to submit,
we must submit or be in rebellion.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>When may we expect the order?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I was informed this very morning that an officer of Governor
Andros was on his way here to take over the government
of the colony, and we might expect him this very
day.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Then what can we do, sir?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>We can submit&mdash;indeed we must submit to the rule of
Governor Andros, but, gentlemen, we must not relinquish
our charter!</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>No, no! We must save our charter. [<i>etc.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But how can we save it? If I am ordered to give it up,
what can I do? I have it here. It is in my possession. How
can I hold it against an order to relinquish it?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Your Excellency, if it is not in your possession, you cannot
give it up.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But it is, Captain Wadsworth.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Then, sir, I move you that this Assembly forthwith take it
out of your possession and intrust it to a committee for
safe-keeping.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, that is possible.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>You have heard the proposal. Those favoring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Opposed&mdash;it is a vote. Will someone propose the committee?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Your Excellency, I propose Captain Wadsworth, Charles
Willys, and John Talcott.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But Talcott is not here.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>All the better, sir, since we cannot give up the charter except
upon unanimous consent of the committee.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>A very good arrangement. Is there a second to the nomination
for the Charter Committee?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second! [<i>loud knock</i>]</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Don't open until we have had the vote! All favoring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>over the noise</i>]</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, I deliver this charter into your hands
for safe-keeping.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>We shall keep it, sir. Never fear!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>calling</i>]</p>

<p>Doorkeeper, open the door!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>What is the meaning of this, sir? Why was I locked out?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Your pardon, sir. But what authority have you, sir, to
break into the Assembly of the General Court of Connecticut?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>I have come to take over the government of this colony
under the authority of Governor Andros.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Indeed, and who are you, if we may be permitted to
know?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Ah, of course&mdash;I have the honor to be Samuel Bligh,
Colonel in His Majesty's service. Are you Robert Treat?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Here are your orders! [<i>rattle of paper</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Thank you. "Hereby ordered"&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;"in compliance
with mandate of His Majesty"&mdash;yes, indeed.
Colonel Bligh, we are ready to turn the government over
to Governor Andros.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Then, sir, you will deliver up the charter to me.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>The charter! The charter&mdash;read the rest of the order,
sir.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>reading</i>]</p>

<p>"Governor Treat is hereby ordered to deliver up the forfeited
charter"&mdash;but, Colonel Bligh, I cannot deliver up
the charter&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Because, sir, it is not in my possession.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>In whose possession is it?</p>

<p>It has been intrusted by the General Court to a special
committee.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Indeed&mdash;and who comprises the committee?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The clerk will read the names of the committee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>May it please you, sir, the committee consists of Captain
Wadsworth, Charles Willys, and John Talcott.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Are any of those named here?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Your name, sir?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, I order you to deliver up the charter
to me.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Oh, yes, and have you an order for it there?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Indeed I have. Governor Treat has just read it.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>May I be allowed to see it?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Of course. Governor Treat, will you let this gentleman
read the order and be satisfied.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p>Hm, yes.&mdash;"Governor Treat&mdash;hereby ordered"&mdash;but,
Colonel, this is an order upon Governor Treat!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Of course it is! Now are you satisfied?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I am deeply sorry, sir, I do not see how the committee can
comply with this order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Why not, pray&mdash;is it not properly signed and sealed?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Oh yes. Signed properly, but it is drawn against the Governor&mdash;and
not against the Charter Committee.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Why&mdash;what&mdash;oh, this is too much! Governor Andros
warned me that you would be stubborn and stiff-necked!
But I'll have that charter! Here&mdash;I'll change that order&mdash;give
it here!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Here you are, sir. [<i>rattle of paper</i>]</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;yes&mdash;a quill. So&mdash;now&mdash;"The Charter Committee&mdash;is
hereby ordered"&mdash;there you are. Now I
hope you are satisfied.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Are you satisfied with this, Governor?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Hm&mdash;does this not seem to be a forgery, Captain Wadsworth?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>It not only seems to be, sir, but it is. I saw him make an
illegal change in the order. All of us saw it.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Yes, yes! We saw him.</p>

<p>It is a forgery! Don't obey it!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I should say that the change invalidated the entire order!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>What? You are trying to put me in the wrong?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Not at all, sir! You have put yourself in the wrong.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>But&mdash;but&mdash;you forced me to make that change in the
order.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I believe, Colonel, we merely pointed out that your order
was inadequate; we did not force you to commit forgery.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Oh, this is a trick! This is a trick! I demand the immediate
surrender of the government and the charter!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>What is the will of the Assembly? Can we deliver up the
government under an order which is obviously forged?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>No, no! No indeed!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The vote is against you, Colonel.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Andros will come himself and attend to this affair. I wash
my hands of it! He'll make you pay for this day's work&mdash;and
he'll get the charter! Good day!</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Good day!</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>Andros did come, as Colonel Bligh had threatened, but not
for several months. But when he came, he came in state,
with a company of soldiers, two trumpeters, and Colonel
Bligh. He intended this time to get the charter, and no
mistake!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Governor Treat called the General Court to assemble on
the evening of October 31, 1687, to confer with Governor
Andros and make one last determined stand to retain the
charter even if there was no way to retain their rights
under the charter.</p>

<p>Our next scene is at the State House in Hartford. It is
evening. The sexton is preparing the room for the meeting
which is about to take place.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON [<i>to himself</i>]</p>

<p>Now these candles, where'd I best put 'em. I cal'ate
mebbe I'd better scatter 'em around the room&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Good even to you, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Even, Captain Wadsworth. Even, Master Allyn.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Good even, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>These candles, Nathan.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir! I was jest a puttin' 'em around where everybody'd
git a little light.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I think perhaps you'd best put them all on the Governor's
table.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>The Governor's table. Yes, sir! So&mdash;one here&mdash;and
one&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>No, no, Nathan. Put them all together at this end of the
table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>This end by the window?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>I think that will be best, don't you, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Of course! The Governor needs a great deal of light.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>But, sir, the draft from the window&mdash;it may blow them
out.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Well, well, if it does, Nathan, we'll just have to light them
all again.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir! Of course, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>low</i>]</p>

<p>Now Allyn, seeing you are the clerk of the General Court,
you can sit at the Governor's table without exciting suspicion.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Yes, Captain!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Best put your chair next the window.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Have you the charter?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Yes, I have it with me, and when Andros demands it I shall
have to produce it.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Andros must not be allowed to get his hand on it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>That will be your duty.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Willys will be waiting outside that window, next your
chair. When the candles go out, grab the charter and toss
it out the window. He'll put it in a safe place.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>You know the oak in front of his house?</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Indeed yes!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>There is a hollow&mdash;high up&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH [<i>louder</i>]</p>

<p>Nathan!</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, Captain!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>A good fire you have in the fireplace.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>I figgered to have a good fire&mdash;it's a mite chilly this
evenin'.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>It may get overly warm in here before the meeting is over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Aye.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I want you to stand close to that window behind John
Allyn's chair.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Don't leave it. And the moment I say, "Sexton, it's warm
in here," throw open the window. You understand?</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>"Sexton, it's warm in here," throw it open. Yes, sir, I
understand.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Never mind what anyone else says. Throw it open on my
signal and throw it wide open.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>But the candles, sir&mdash;they may go out. They're right
close to the window.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Never mind the candles.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Never mind them&mdash;yes, sir! [<i>trumpets sound outside</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Here comes Andros. Throw open the door.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Never mind, Nathan. I'll do it. You stay by that window.</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>The window. Yes, sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Enter, Governor Andros.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Thank you. Governor Treat&mdash;I now call you that for
the last time&mdash;will you show me to my place?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Of course, sir. Captain Wadsworth, will you usher us to
our places?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Right this way, Governor. We have arranged this place
for you.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Thank you. Do we need all the candles here?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>For you and the clerk. [<i>noise and confusion of members
entering</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Yes, yes! Of course! Treat, will you sit at my left?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Thank you, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Will you call the Assembly to order?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Gentlemen, will you take your places. [<i>sound of gavel</i>]
The Assembly will please come to order! [<i>quiet</i>] In accordance
with the command of His Majesty we are met
here to surrender the government of the Connecticut Colony
to the Royal Governor, Sir Edmund Andros. On behalf
of this Assembly, I have the honor, sir, to welcome
you and assure you of our submission to His Majesty's
command. We have ever been a loyal and a law-abiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
people. We surrender the prerogatives of government under
our charter with regret; but His Majesty commands,
and we, his loyal subjects, have nought to do but obey.
We are, sir, yours to command.</p>

<p class="center">ALL [<i>cheers</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Thank you, Master Treat. I am agreeably pleased at the
expression of obedience. In the name of His Majesty I
hereby take command of the colony of Connecticut and
order it joined to the colony of Massachusetts Bay, of
which you shall henceforth be a part. And now, you
have only to surrender the charter to me to complete the
ceremony of submission to the order of His Majesty.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But, sir, we have signified our submission. The surrender
of the charter is quite another thing.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>It was granted in perpetuity, to be forfeited only through
due process of law.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Have you not been informed, sir, that a writ of quo warranto
issued in the proper courts of England was tried and
went by default last February?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Last February? Indeed, sir! We had no knowledge that
any action was brought against it. Who was the complainant?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I was!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>You, sir?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed, you seem to have forgotten an occasion when I
promised you I'd get your charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>No, sir! Unfortunately I still remember it!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I have here the original court order, declaring your charter
forfeit, and I shall now trouble your Charter Committee
to produce the original document.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>One moment, sir. Has not every Englishman a right to
defend his case before a court of law?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Of course&mdash;you had such a chance and failed to appear.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>We had no notice of the action.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>That's not my fault.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The court is in error, and we shall appeal.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Appeal all you like; but produce the charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>We do so under protest.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah, very well. I care not how much you protest. Once
I get the charter, I can assure you, you'll never see it again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Produce the charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, place the charter on the table.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Here it is, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah&mdash;at last!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>One moment, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>What now?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Will you first sign the receipt for the charter, so that the
committee may be protected?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Why, certainly, if you wish. It's no matter; but I'll do it.
Give me your quill, clerk.</p>

<p class="center">ALLYN</p>

<p>Here you are, sir&mdash;and paper.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Yes. Hm&mdash;"received&mdash;charter&mdash;signed"&mdash;there&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Sexton, it's warm in here!</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir! [<i>noise of window</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Hey, the lights! Quick, what's happened? Lights! Lights!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>The candles have all blown out!</p>

<p>Put down the window!</p>

<p>What's the matter&mdash;[<i>etc.</i>] [<i>exclamations continue
through the scene</i>]</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Put that window down! What are you trying to do?</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Why, sir, it was warm.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Put it down, I say! Light those candles! What foolishness
is this? Light those candles, I say! Do you hear me?</p>

<p class="center">SEXTON</p>

<p>Yes, sir, at once, sir! [<i>noise of window going down</i>]</p>

<p>Here, sir, I'll light the candles. I'm right sorry, sir. Now,
where did I put my flint? Ah, here it is. There you are,
sir. I'm right sorry I put you out, sir. I didn't think&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Fool! Now, Treat, hand me the charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>The charter&mdash;why, sir&mdash;you had it.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Had it? What are you talking about?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Why, sir! I saw you put your hand on it the moment the
lights went out.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed I did not. Give it here!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>But, sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Hey&mdash;you&mdash;Captain&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Wadsworth, give me the charter!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>But, sir, I gave it to you.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>You did not!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>But I have here your receipt for it!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Give me back that receipt!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I shall certainly do nothing of the kind, sir. I gave you
the charter; you gave me this receipt for it. I have here
twenty witnesses to the transaction!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I'm being tricked! I say I will have that charter. It's
somewhere here, and I'll have it. [<i>calling</i>] Colonel Bligh!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>distance</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Surround this place with your soldiers. Don't let a single
man leave until he has been searched!</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Sir, this is illegal! You have no search warrants!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed! I'll do it whether it's legal or not. I'll have that
charter, I tell you, if I have to search every spot in this
town! I'll have it, I say I'll have it.</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>And so the great search began. All that night and into
the next day the Governor, the Colonel, and their soldiers
searched high and low for the missing charter. At last
they came to the house of Charles Willys, in front of
which stood the great oak in which the charter lay safely
hidden.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Who lives here?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>This is the home of Charles Willys!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Indeed! One of the Charter Committee, eh?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Good! Search this place inside and out, Colonel. Don't
leave a thing unturned.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Very good, sir! Search this place, Captain&mdash;thoroughly.
Tear up the floors, dig up the garden, rip the upholstery
off the furniture, but find that charter!</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir. Follow me!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Bring out the master of the house. The rest of you back
up against this tree and don't move!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Sir, I protest again&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Protest all you like. It will do you no good until you produce
that charter.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>I don't know where it is. You had it, that's all I know.
If you lost it, it is not our fault.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Silence!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>a little distance</i>]</p>

<p>Here's the master of the house, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah, indeed! Are you Master Willys?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Where is the charter?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>Your pardon, sir, but how should I know?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>You were a member of the Charter Committee, were you
not?</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I was!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Then where is it?</p>

<p>Yes?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>What then, sir?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Do you see this oak tree?</p>

<p>I'm not blind, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>I'll have you strung up&mdash;strung up in it, sir; I'll have you
strung up in it!</p>

<p class="center">WILLYS</p>

<p>I should hate to have such a fine tree perverted to such a
purpose, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah! You would! Colonel Bligh! Colonel!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH [<i>distance</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, Governor!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Send me half a dozen soldiers and a stout rope!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Yes, sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah! Now perhaps we'll get something from you. Will
you tell me or will you be hanged by your thumbs from
that stout limb up there until you are ready to tell me
where the charter is?</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Governor Andros, I fear you have forgotten yourself in
your rage. Master Willys is entitled to a trial before any
such punishment can be meted out to him.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Silence, or I'll have you strung up with him! Gad, sir,
I'll fill this oak tree with stiff-necked rebellious Connecticut
men, but I'll have that charter!</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Here are your men, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Good! One of you climb that oak tree. Here, you, Sergeant.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Yes, sir!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Give him a hand there. [<i>sound of starting to climb the
tree</i>] Have the men found anything in the house, Colonel?</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Not a thing, sir!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Look here, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Ah, Captain Wadsworth. Have you something to say?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>I have, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Speak out.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Tell those men to stay out of that tree and I'll tell you.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>All right, Sergeant, come down. I thought we'd get something
out of them if we scared them. Well, Captain?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Sir, you have lost the charter; that is clear.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Where is it?</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Just a minute. You have lost it. You also have given us
your receipt for it; therefore you should have it.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>And I intend to have it.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>You can't. I can assure you of that, but here is what I
propose. The committee is willing to turn over the receipt
to you if you will stop this foolish and destructive search
for something you can't find.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Never! Sergeant, go up that tree again. We'll string
these fellows up.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Ah, very well, then. But, sir, you'll look very foolish
when you report to the Privy Council that you did not get
the charter, and we produce your signed receipt!</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>What?&mdash;Hm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, Governor. How will you explain that to the
King?</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>What? Why! Ah&mdash;very well then, give me the receipt
and I'll leave. After all, your charter will do you no good.
It's revoked.</p>

<p class="center">TREAT</p>

<p>Exactly! That's a very sensible view to take, Governor
Andros. I congratulate you.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Here is the receipt, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Humph!</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>You're very welcome, sir.</p>

<p class="center">ANDROS</p>

<p>Colonel Bligh, draw up your guard and prepare to return
to Boston. [<i>orders and confusion</i>]</p>

<p class="center">TREAT [<i>over the noise</i>]</p>

<p>My congratulations, Captain Wadsworth. A good bargain.</p>

<p class="center">WADSWORTH</p>

<p>Indeed it was. Another foot up the tree, and the Sergeant
would have had the charter.</p>

<p class="center">BLIGH</p>

<p>Quick step, march!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>By saving the charter Connecticut preserved her claim to
separate government, and in 1694 the King decided that
the charter was in full legal force. It served as the fundamental
order of Connecticut government down to the
Revolution and until 1818, when a new state constitution
superseded it.</p>

<p>The oak in which the charter was so well hidden was called
from that time the "Charter Oak." It stood until August
21, 1856, when it fell. At sunset of that day the bells of
Hartford tolled, and mourning was displayed for the historic
old tree. And today interested tourists may see the
spot where the Charter Oak stood and see a piece of the old
tree in the State House.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
